We appreciate your interest in improving this project. Before you start contributing, please take a moment to review the following guidelines.


## Reporting Issues

First off, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](http://juliahealth.org/OMOPCDMFeasibility.jl/).

Before you report an issue, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/OMOPCDMFeasibility.jl/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue.

If you then still feel the need to report an issue, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/OMOPCDMFeasibility.jl/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions, depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.


## How to Contribute
