# Welcome to OMOPCDMFeasibility.jl

OMOPCDMFeasibility.jl helps you run feasibility checks on OMOP CDM data and cohorts.
Use it to validate inputs, summarize key cohort characteristics, and ensure your data is ready for downstream analysis.

## What you can do

- Run pre-cohort feasibility checks (e.g., completeness and source table readiness).
- Run post-cohort feasibility checks (e.g., cohort size and basic summaries).

## Get started

Head to the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) to set up your environment and run your first checks.

- [Post-Cohort Analysis](postcohort.md)
- [API Reference](api.md)
